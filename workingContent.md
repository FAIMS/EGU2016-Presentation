# Instructions 

Authors are kindly asked to prepare one presentation file fulfilling both needs, the introductory 2-minutes-madness as well as the following intensive viewing and discussions. Please include the summary of your work in the first two slides followed by an unlimited number of slides going more into detail. The touch screens have a size of 42". The operating system is Windows 7 and they have internet access. Although the screens are in the 16:9 widescreen format, we recommend producing Power Point or PDF presentations in the classic 4:3 format. The extra space is used for the branding of the contribution as well as the navigation. The touch screens show three buttons allowing you to move forwards and backwards in the presentation as well as to access the table of contents (PICO programme) of that particular session. Please note that Prezi is not supported.
